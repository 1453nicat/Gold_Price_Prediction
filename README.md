# Gold_Price_Prediction
This project predicts gold prices using historical market data from 2015 to 2025.

This project aims to predict gold prices using historical data and compare the performance of three linear regression techniques with regularization: **Ridge**, **Lasso**, and **ElasticNet**. The dataset spans from **2015 to 2025** and includes relevant financial indicators. The goal is to build a robust and interpretable model to forecast gold prices and analyze which method generalizes best.
